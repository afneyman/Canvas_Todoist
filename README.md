# Canvas_Todoist
  I'm currently a student at university and the majority of my assignments and projects are posted to a platform called canvas. Canvas, overall, is a solid way to connect teachers with students and allow access to necessary files, updates, and lecture videos. Canvas attempts to be a "one stop shop" for students but the calender feature does not stack up to google calender and the to-do list does not compare to other dedicated platforms such as my top choice, Todoist. 
  
  My initial (and current) goal of this project is to create an script that continuously updates my Todoist homework list with assignments that my teachers post. Ideally, the script would be able to continuously run to allow for real-time updates to my assignments.
   I plan on creating the entire project myself and then seeking advice on the code afterwords. As one of my first personal projects, there will be plenty of sphaghetti code that could probably be significantly more efficient but making the script functional is the primary goal.
